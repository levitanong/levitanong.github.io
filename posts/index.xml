      <description>Summary Many companies and organizations subsidize certain things like transit, food, and lodging for their employees, provided the latter log these expenses via some system defined by the former. My company uses Airtable.&amp;nbsp;1
If you use Ledger to maintain your personal accounting, or really any other method for that matter (but seriously. Use Ledger), it will be tedious to log your subsidized/reimbursable expenses on both books. Despite the inconvenience, this data is valuable to you, and you should keep track of it to better understand your lifestyle.</description>
