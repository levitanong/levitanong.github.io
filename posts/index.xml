      <description>Changelog 2019/4/13 My PR implementing ledger-xact-date got accepted, so had to rewrite a bunch.
 Merged payee and date sections into new xact section. Added utility function to get transaction amount value. Changed implementation of final airtable exporting function to make use of ledger-xact-date and ledger-transaction-amount-value  Summary Many companies and organizations subsidize certain things like transit, food, and lodging for their employees, provided the latter log these expenses via some system defined by the former.</description>
